# Real-time 1-1 messaging application

## Powered by Firebase

The app back-end is powered by Google Firebase for both data persistence and user authentication. You have to type the email address of the recipient you want to chat with. Keep in mind that the email you enter only works if that recipient has logged into the app at least once in the past.
